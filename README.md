"I wonder if king size sheets are called presidential sized in England. I really should have a tweeter account." -Dwight Schrute

Well..Dwight finally got his tweeter account.

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.  It was built with HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery and AJAX on the client-side, and Node, Express, and MongoDB on the server-side.  Happy tweeting!
